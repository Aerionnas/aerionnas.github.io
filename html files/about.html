                                <div class="add-spacing">Hi! My name is Aerionna Stephenson. I live in Atlanta, Georgia. I am a
                                    recent alumna of Brandeis University with a dual degree in Hispanic Studies and Latin American,
                                    Caribbean and Latinx Studies. During my undergraduate experience, I produced several 
                                    projects centering on Afro-Latinx and Indigenous peoples, and I continue to make efforts to 
                                    connect people across the diasporas. In addition, I was afforded the opportunity to take several 
                                    Computer Science courses covering a wide range of topics such as Core Java, Python, Racket, Three.js, 
                                    the Lean Startup process, and Discrete Structures. Of these topics, I feel the most passionate about Java. 
                                    I have a solid foundation in the fundamentals, basic algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, 
                                    file handling using CRUD operations, and Graphical User Interfaces. I am always looking for new ways to 
                                    cultivate these skills and expand my expertise.

                                    Since graduating from college, I participated in the Opportunity College Career Jumpstart Fellowship Program.
                                    I took a course in Junior Web Development, and I was able to master the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, 
                                    Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery, and Mocha. In this course, I demonstrated my ability to make contributions in a team 
                                    setting, meet deadlines for assignments, work independently to learn new topics, display a strong attention to detail, 
                                    critically think to find solutions to problems, and ask questions when necessary. I was able to create this portfolio 
                                    website and a Task planner web application. Upon completing the program, I successfully earned my W3Schools JavaScript 
                                    Certification. I am currently taking the Google UX Design Professional Certificate Coursera Course to improve the user
                                    experience of my web applications.

                                    I describe myself as being multi-dimensional and able to adapt to any
                                    environment that I am placed. In addition to my technical knowledge, I am strong
                                    in the following areas: leadership, growth mindset, persistence, attention to detail,
                                    and communication. These skills afford me the ability to operate as a well-rounded
                                    individual able to take on any challenge. In addition, I have a plethora of experiences 
                                    that I am able draw from in moments of uncertainty. With this skills and my technical 
                                    background, I am confident that I will thrive in a professional setting. I am very excited
                                    to put these skills into practice and to contribute to a team setting. My passion is
                                    to create user-friendly websites for businesses and use my technical experience to
                                    find solutions to global issues.
